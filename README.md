# CannonDuel
## Prototype Tank Battle with Dynamic Terrain

**CannonDuel** is a **C++ prototype** built with **SFML**.
It focuses on **tank battles** and **dynamic terrain destruction**, providing a simple but fun gameplay loop.

---

## Gameplay

- Two stationary tanks positioned on the left and right of the screen.  
- Each tank's cannon **oscillates automatically** from side to side.  
- Press **charge** to prepare a shot, which is fired based on the current cannon angle.  
- The terrain is **destructible**: when a projectile hits, it modifies the terrain array, creating a realistic “hole” in the ground.  
- Each tank has **3 lives**; the goal is to eliminate the opponent.

## Controls

- **Charge Button** → Charge your shot  
- **Release Button** → Shoot when fully charged (shot follows cannon angle)  

---

## Features

- Automatic cannon oscillation for both tanks  
- Projectile physics affecting **dynamic terrain**  
- Destructible terrain implemented via array for realistic deformation  
- Basic prototype with functional gameplay mechanics  
- Tank health and simple win/lose condition  

---

## Objective

- Destroy the enemy tank before it destroys you.  
- Strategically aim and time your shots to modify the terrain and create tactical advantages.

---

## Note

- Prototype stage: graphics are minimal and gameplay is focused on mechanics rather than visual polish.  
- Main focus: **terrain destruction** and **shooting mechanics**.
